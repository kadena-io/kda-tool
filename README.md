# Using Kda-tool

## Getting Help

Kda-tool has bult-in help facilities that give information about available
commands and options. The command `kda -h` or `kda --help` will give you a
top-level summary of available commands. Adding `-h` or `--help` to any partial
command will give you help for that command.

## Transaction Construction & Templating

Kda-tool uses mustache templates to let you quickly and easily construct
transactions for multiple chains and many other access patterns. It provides two
commands for doing this: `gen` and `tx`.

### `kda gen`

This command takes a transaction template file (usually denoted with a `.ktpl`
extension) and fills the template with user-supplied values. To illustrate,
let's look at a concrete example template for a simple transfer. Consider the
following file we'll call `transfer.ktpl`:

#### Generating a single transaction

```
code: |-
  (coin.transfer "{{{from-acct}}}" "{{{to-acct}}}" {{amount}})
data:
meta:
  chainId: "{{chain}}"
  sender: "{{{from-acct}}}"
  gasLimit: 2300
  gasPrice: 0.000001
  ttl: 600
networkId: testnet04
signers:
  - public: badbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadb
    caps:
      - name: "coin.TRANSFER"
        args: ["{{{from-acct}}}", "{{{to-acct}}}", {{amount}}]
      - name: "coin.GAS"
        args: []
type: exec
```

You can get a list of all the values this template needs with the `--holes`
option which prints the following:

```
$ kda gen transfer.ktpl --holes
amount: null
chain: null
from-acct: null
to-acct: null
```

We can save this to a file with `kda gen transfer.ktpl --holes > data.yaml`.
Then we can edit this file with the following values:

```
amount: 1.5
chain: 0
from-acct: alice
to-acct: bob
```

Then we can generate a transaction from this template as follows:

```
$ kda gen transfer.ktpl -d data.yaml
Wrote commands to: ["tx.yaml"]
```

The file `tx.yaml` contains a finalized transaction that has no signatures and
will need to be signed before it can be submitted to the blockchain. See the
next section "Transaction Signing" to see how you can use kda-tool to sign this
transaction.

If you do not supply `-d`, kda-tool will prompt you to enter all the necessary
information.

#### Generating multiple transactions

We can use the same `transfer.ktpl` template to generate transactions on
multiple chains by making a simple change to the `data.yaml` file:

```
amount: 1.5
chain: [0,1,2]
from-acct: alice
to-acct: bob
```

All the data is the same as before except we changed the `chain` field to a
list. When kda-tool sees a list it generates a separate transaction using each
value in the list:

```
$ kda gen transfer.ktpl -d data.yaml
Wrote commands to: ["tx-0.yaml","tx-1.yaml","tx-2.yaml"]
```

These three files contain transactions for transferring 1.5 KDA from alice to
bob on chains 0, 1, and 2.

You can use lists for any field. For example, we could use the following to
transfer 0.1 KDA from alice to each of bob, carol, and dave:

```
amount: 0.1
chain: 0
from-acct: alice
to-acct: [bob, carol, dave]
```

Generating using this data gives something slightly different:

```
$ kda gen transfer.ktpl -d data.yaml
Wrote commands to: ["tx-bob.yaml","tx-carol.yaml","tx-dave.yaml"]
```

The filename is `tx-` followed by the value of the field you're looping over.
You can set your own filename scheme using the `-o` option and a
mustache-templated filename as follows:

```
$ kda gen transfer.ktpl -d data.yaml -o foo_{{to-acct}}_bar.yaml
Wrote commands to: ["foo_bob_bar.yaml","foo_carol_bar.yaml","foo_dave_bar.yaml"]
```

If you want to transfer a different amount on each chain, you can also put a
list in the amount field as follows:

```
amount: ["1.0","2.0","3.0"]
chain: [0,1,2]
from-acct: alice
to-acct: bob
```

The two lists must be the same length otherwise kda-tool will throw an error.
Note that the amounts are strings because YAML does not distinguish between
integer and decimal but Pact does. This will generate three separate
transactions transferring 1 KDA on chain 0, 2 KDA on chain 1, and 3 KDA on chain
2.

# Kda-tool Data Formats

### Key Formats

There are two key formats: plain and hd.

#### Plain Key Format

The first is a plain ED25519 key format compatible with Pact which is a YAML
file with two fields: `public` and `secret`.

```
public: 40c1e2e86cc3974cc29b8953e127c1f31905665fcc98846ebf6c00cb8610a213
secret: badbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbade
```

#### HD Key Format

The second format is a 12-word recovery phrase compatible with Chainweaver HD
key generation. This format consists of all 12 words on a single line, each word
separated by a single space.

```
acid baby cage dad earn face gain hair ice jar keen lab
```

An arbitrary number of key pairs can be generated from a single 12-word recovery
phrase, each pair identified by an index which is a natural number.

### Transaction Formats

Need to find the right names for the transaction formats.

#### Template


#### Finalized

`SigData` ... more recently evolved to `CommandSigData` from the signing API

#### Fully Signed

Pact's `Command Text`

```
{
  "hash": "H6XjdPHzMai2HLa3_yVkXfkFYMgA0bGfsB0kOsHAMuI",
  "sigs": [
    {
      "sig": "8d452109cc0439234c093b5e204a7428bc0a54f22704402492e027aaa9375a34c910d8a468a12746d0d29e9353f4a3fbebe920d63bcc7963853995db015d060f"
    }
  ],
  "cmd": "{\"payload\":{\"exec\":{\"data\":null,\"code\":\"(+ 1 2)\"}},\"signers\":[{\"pubKey\":\"368820f80c324bbc7c2b0610688a7da43e39f91d118732671cd9c7500ff43cca\"}],\"meta\":{\"gasLimit\":1000,\"chainId\":\"0\",\"gasPrice\":1.0e-2,\"sender\":\"368820f80c324bbc7c2b0610688a7da43e39f91d118732671cd9c7500ff43cca\"},\"nonce\":\"nonce-value\"}"
}
```

## Requirements

### Shell Composability

This tool's subcommands should be designed in a way that they are easily
composable using standard shell facilities such as pipes, redirecting to
files, etc.

### No sensitive data on the command line.

This includes private keys, seed phrases, etc.  These pieces of sensitive
information should never be typed on the command line to prevent accidental
exposure via shell history logs.

Early on in this tool's evolution it probably won't do anything involving
signing.  There are already other tools for this such as the `pact` command
line tool, [keychain](https://github.com/kadena-community/keychain), etc.
However, this tool could easily evolve to include signing capabilities and in
that case data protections will be important.
